    I investigated how income affects SAT scores in different states. For each state, I calculated the percent difference in
    SAT scores between high income and low income students. Here, we define <b>high income</b> students to be those with yearly
    family income exceeding $100k and <b>low income</b> students to be those with yearly family income less than $20k. This difference,
    called <b>percent difference</b>, is shown for each state using its color so the viewer can see right away
    in which states income level makes more or less of a difference on SAT scores.
    </p>

    <p>
    I made the following prototypes of my home page, showing information for the entire USA, and the page showing information
    about individual states. The prototypes condense the SAT scores data into just the difference in scores by income level,
    and they make it easy for the viewer to compare this difference by region by looking at the map.

    <h3>Feedback</h3>

    <p>I received the following feedback from my peers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Majestic
        </li>
        <li>
            For the home page, make it more clear that the color reflects the percent difference in SAT scores
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a more descriptive title for the page for individual states
        </li>
        <li>
            Consider making a dropdown menu for the year instead of a slider
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I did not end up using all of the feedback, but my main takeaway was that I should make it more clear what the data in
        the infographic represents. I therefore moved the explanation that I measure the difference in SAT scores between students
        whose families earn more than $100k/year and less than $20k/year from the text-based discussion into a caption below the
        legend, so that all of the necessary information was contained in one place in the infographic. I also changed the title of
        the page in the second prototype to include that the SAT scores are divided by income level.
